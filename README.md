# Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis (2019-2020)
This repository contains the end-to-end analysis of a credit card transaction dataset to identify and predict instances of fraud. The project involves exploratory data analysis using SQL, Python and Microsoft Power BI.

## Project Overview & Objective
A new credit card company in the western United States wants to establish itself as a market leader in security. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a provided dataset. A key requirement is that the model should prioritize catching as many fraudulent cases as possible (high recall), even if it means occasionally flagging a legitimate transaction for review.

## Visualizations & Key Dashboards
Below are some of the key visualizations in Microsoft Power BI. These charts highlight the primary findings from the exploratory data analysis phase.
